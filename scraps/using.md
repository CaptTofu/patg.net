## Installing and configuring Docker

The [installation][docker_install] directions on the [Docker website][Docker] are excellent and provide instructions for the various Linux distributions as well as running on virtual machines on non-Linux OSs.

In addition to their instructions, I needed containers to use 0.0.0.0 when binding container ports so it will be possible to connect to a container running on one cartridge from an external server (external to the [Docker][Docker] host). The following was added to the end of the file /etc/defaults/docker:
    DOCKER_OPTS="--ip=0.0.0.0"

With this option, it is possible to run containers and have any exposed ports on the container to be bound to ports on the host. There will be more elaboration on this in a later section of this post.

## Running the Docker Daemon on a socket or port

By default, [Docker][Docker] will runs so that it binds to a UNIX socket versus a TCP socket on 127.0.0.1. There is a good reason for this: [Docker][Docker] runs as root. There are risks of cross-site-scripting attacks using a TCP socket if you are not on a completely trusted network or VPN (or both).

I recently investigated and ended up demonstrating using [Ansible][Ansible] [modules][ansible-docker] to manage containers run across 45 cartridges on a Moonshot server. Since the network was behind a VPN, completely trusted, and locked down (even using an internal apt repo) the [Docker][Docker] daemon was set to run as a service on port 4243 so that the [Ansible][Ansible] modules, run via playbooks on a single host, could connect and communicate with these 45 [Docker][Docker] daemons running on each cartridge. This also makes it possible to connect to Docker locally as a non-privileged user. The option for this was set in /etc/defaults/docker:

    DOCKER_OPTS="--host=tcp://0.0.0.0:4243‚Äù

I will stress again that this was a need for what I had to do for my specific setup and ONLY use a setup like this if you have a secure setup. Also make sure that access to port you use (for instance, 4243 in the example above) is limited to only the host that needs to access it. In my case, it was the host I was running [Ansible][Ansible] playbooks on.


## Sign up for an account

So you can share your images as well as follow this blog post, it is recommended that you sign up for an Docker account. Follow the '[sign up][docker_signup]' link next to 'login' in the upper right hand corner of the page. This will be a name you want to use to tag your images with and the string value that when searched on, will display your images for someone interested.


## About using sudo to run the [Docker CLI][Docker CLI]

The documentation on the [Docker][Docker] site has docker commands run via sudo. This is a best practice and assumed setup for security purposes. As mentioned before, [Docker][Docker] runs as root, so it's important to make sure that only trusted users can run [Docker][Docker]. In the case of most developers running [Docker][Docker] locally either on a laptop of VM, since there would only be one user to concern themselves with, could set up their system to allow a given user the ability to not have to preface every docker command with sudo. The following will set this up:

    $ sudo groupadd docker
    $ sudo gpasswd -a myusername docker # myusername == user in question
    $ sudo service docker restart

Note: The above steps are for Ubuntu. Mileage may vary for other Linux variants.

## Summary

This second blog post in the series of "Docker: containers for the masses - installation" discussed how Docker installationb and configuration, providing information on some other specifics that the author has found in working with Docker particular to configuration issues. These included: how to run the Docker daemon, running Docker bound to a UNIX socket versus a TCP socket as well as the use of sudo for running the [Docker CLI][docker_cli]. 

The next post will cover actual usage of [Docker][Docker].

## Using Docker

As alread mentioned, the [Docker CLI][docker_cli] was very intuitive and has a well-documented help facility that can simply be invoked by running

    $ docker help subcommand

For instance, if one were to need to find otu the options on building images:

    $ docker help build

    Usage: docker build [OPTIONS] PATH | URL | -

    Build a new container image from the source code at PATH

      --no-cache=false   Do not use cache when building the image
      -q, --quiet=false  Suppress the verbose output generated by the containers
      --rm=true          Remove intermediate containers after a successful build
      -t, --tag=""       Repository name (and optionally a tag) to be applied to the resulting image in case of success

The following shows basic usage of Docker and some common tasks that a user would perform.

## Pulling a base Ubuntu image

The first thing to do was to build images based off of Ubuntu. To obtain a base image, and in this case, the Ubuntu base image, I did a search to find out the image tag in order to  pull the Ubuntu image from the [Docker][Docker] image repository:

    $ docker search ubuntu
    NAME                         DESCRIPTION                                     STARS   OFFICIAL   TRUSTED
    ubuntu                       Official Ubuntu base image                      171
    stackbrew/ubuntu             Barebone ubuntu images                          36

    ...<snip>...

The list was extensive, and the first one selected:

    $ docker pull ubuntu

    ... <snip> ...

## Launching a container

Once the base Ubuntu image was pulled, it was possible to launch a container using it. In this example, the flags -i -t were specified to indicate running interactively and to use a pseudo terminal. Later, it will be showin how to run a container that runs sshd that can be logged into

    $ docker -it run ubuntu /bin/bash
    root@849e71a53c2c:/#

At this point, changes can be made to the container and any commits will create images representative of the changes made.

One the session is exited, the container also exits.

## Analyzing your container

You can now verify and find out the container ID of the container you are running. In another terminal, you can run the following:

    $ docker ps
    CONTAINER ID  IMAGE         COMMAND    CREATED        STATUS        PORTS  NAMES
    849e71a53c2c  ubuntu:14.04  /bin/bash  2 minutes ago  Up 2 minutes         loving_bardeen

You could also run 'ps' with a -a flag to see all containers you have run both running and terminated:

    $ docker ps -a
    CONTAINER ID  IMAGE         COMMAND    CREATED        STATUS                     PORTS  NAMES
    7f5881636580  ubuntu:14.04  /bin/bash  3 seconds ago  Exited (0) 1 seconds ago          clever_shockley
    94d4341afefa  ubuntu:14.04  /bin/bash  7 seconds ago  Exited (0) 4 seconds ago          happy_bardeen
    849e71a53c2c  ubuntu:14.04  /bin/bash  17 hours ago   Up 17 hours                       loving_bardeen

As you can see above, the container you are currently running is still shown as running, and the author of this blog has left it up for 17 hours so fire while writing this part of the post!

## Connecting to a container

When you run a virtual machine, you are accustomed to the idea of being able to ssh into it. If you run Docker as in the above example, interactively, you obviously are running a shell that allows you to do work inside of your container. You can also connect to it:

    $ docker attach 849e71a53c2c
    root@849e71a53c2c:/#

## Inspecting a container

One command that will be often used is the inspection command. This command, when run, will produce a large JSON data structure with every bit of information you would ever want to know about the container. Most often, when I use it, I have wanted to find out either the IP address or what ports docker uses for exposed ports:

    $ docker inspect 849e71a53c2c

## Committing a container and creating images

As mentioned in the previous example, it would have been possible to commit the container to an image. In order to do this, one will need the container ID. To find this, one of the most used commands you will familiarize yourself with is the docker ps command:

    $ docker ps
    CONTAINER ID  IMAGE         COMMAND    CREATED        STATUS        PORTS  NAMES
    849e71a53c2c  ubuntu:14.04  /bin/bash  2 minutes ago  Up 2 minutes         loving_bardeen

Once the container ID is known, the container can be committed to an image:

    $ docker commit 849e71a53c2c capttofu/ubuntu_example
    f54ee24a549a4680966d12db4071da61470ff2c979b0177405f07f860d08ab63

To verify that there is now an image created from the previous step

    patg@ubuntu:~$ docker images
    REPOSITORY                TAG      IMAGE ID      CREATED        VIRTUAL SIZE

It's also possible to see the history of this newly-created image, showing what changes it is comprised of:

    $ docker history capttofu/ubuntu_example
    IMAGE               CREATED             CREATED BY                                      SIZE

## Pushing up your image

Once you have an image built the way you want it and think it's ready for sharing, you can push it up to the public [Docker][Docker] [image repo][docker_image_repo]:

    $ docker push capttofu/ubuntu_example
    $ docker push capttofu/ubuntu_example
    The push refers to a repository [capttofu/ubuntu_example] (len: 1)
    Sending image list
    Pushing repository capttofu/ubuntu_example (1 tags)

## Building images using a Dockerfile

While it is certainly easy to launch a base image, modify it and then commit the changes, it's not something tenable for the long-term purposes of automation and everyday work. This is where using a "[Dockerfile][dockerfile]" is the solution. A "[Dockerfile][dockerfile]" is another great example on the utility of Docker and analogous to a Makefile. It is a simple file that describes a set of instructions for how an image is to be built. For instance, below is a simple [Dockerfile][dockerfile] that can be used to install Percona XtraDB Cluster:

    # Percona XtraDB Cluster Dockerfile
    #
    # VERSION    0.0.1
    #
    FROM ubuntu:13.04
    MAINTAINER Patrick aka CaptTofu Galbraith , patg@patg.net

    # Add the Percona apt repository
    RUN apt-key adv --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 1C4CBDCDCD2EFD2A
    ADD percona.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/percona.list

    # Update distribution
    RUN apt-get update \
          && apt-get upgrade -y \
          && apt-get clean

    # Install ssh, vim and PXC packages
    RUN DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y ssh vim percona-xtradb-cluster-client-5.6 percona-xtradb-cluster-server-5.6

    # set up ssh and authorized keys so one can ssh into this system
    RUN mkdir /var/run/sshd
    RUN mkdir /root/.ssh
    RUN chmod 700 /root/.ssh
    ADD docker.pem.pub /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
    RUN chown -R root:root /root/.ssh

    # add entrypoint script used to start processes
    ADD entrypoint.sh /usr/local/sbin/entrypoint.sh

    # Expose SSH and MySQL ports
    EXPOSE 22 3306 4444 4567 9200

    # Set the entrypoint to entrypoint.sh
    ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/sbin/entrypoint.sh"]

As you can see, there are several instructions in this [Dockerfile][dockerfile] that you would commonly use. The RUN instruction is used to set up apt repositories and update the system, the ADD instruction which adds a file to the specific location and name, in this case a script used as an ENTRYPOINT instruction, which is what the container be executed as. The EXPOSE instruction is used to inform docker which ports the container will listen on, in this case ports needed for ssh and Galera replication and automatic failover setup.

Do take note that since the ENTRYPOINT instruction is used, this container will be run differently than the previous example above. This will be explained later in this post. 

## Building an image using a Dockerfile

Building the image is painfully simple:

After this is completed, there is an image tagged as capttofu/pxc to use. You can run "docker images" to see it.

## Building images with running services

In my testing, I found that I prefered building containers with running services, particularly sshd, that would allow me to access a running container either through SSH or a database connection (think PaaS applications, DBaaS, etc). To do this, you will need to ensure the service of your choice is started when the container runs. As seen in previous exemples in this post, a shell script called "entrypoint.sh" was used. An example of a simple entrypoint script that starts ssh is:

    #!/bin/bash

    /usr/sbin/sshd -D

If this script is added to the container, set with appropriate permissions, it will run when the container is launched, allowing you to ssh into the container. Note that other commands can be added to this. For instance, in the case of the Percona XtraDB Cluster container, "service start mysql" is also added. 

To launch images with entrypoints, you issue "docker run" differently, with the "-d" flag, which means "detach"

    $ docker run -d capttofu/pxc
    $ docker run -d --name pxc1 289923

Note: In the example above, only the first 6 characters of the image ID was used. As long as the string used in any Docker command is used that pertains to an ID, as long as it is unique, it will work. Had there been another image ID with the same 6 characters, it would have been ambiguous and failed.
 
The next thing that needs to be done is to ensure the container is running:

    $ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                            NAMES
59b7425cd5cf        289923fa1196        "/bin/sh -c "/usr/lo   2 seconds ago       Up 1 seconds        22/tcp, 3306/tcp, 4444/tcp, 4567/tcp, 9200/tcp   pxc1

Then find out the IP address of the container by grepping the output of "docker inspect":

    $ docker inspect pxc1|grep IPA
          "IPAddress": "172.17.0.2",

And ssh into the container!

    $ ssh root@172.17.0.2

    root@59b7425cd5cf:~# ps aux
    USER  PID  %CPU %MEM VSZ     RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND

    root  13   0.0  0.0  75648   3720 ?       Ss   11:25   0:00 sshd: root@pts/0
    root  25   0.0  0.0  18168   2080 pts/0   Ss   11:25   0:00 -bash

    root  186  0.0  0.0  15572   1196 pts/0   R+   11:33   0:00 ps aux

See above the reading of processes. This provides a good example of how when within a container, it's apparent how the numer of processes is limited to only the application in question (and SSH). To me, this is great technology, and something that I wish I had had available years ago!

## About ports exposure and publishing

In the interest if wrapping up this post but still covering something of importance, is the next bit of information to cover pertains to ports and how they are exposed. In an upcoming post detailing my work with Docker and Ansible, I provide a demonstration of working with Docker across 45 Moonshot cartridges (in other words, bare-metal servers). To be able to reach Docker containers from external hosts, I mentioned above how there is a Docker setting to set containers to run bound to 0.0.0.0. The other required piece of this requires having Docker bind a given port of the container to a port on the Docker host. For instance, I want to be able to SSH into on my containers from an external host, from HostA to where containers on HostB. HostB would be running one or more containers and each would have sshd running on port 22. How do I ssh to any one of the containers on HostB and reach the correct container yet know what SSH port to use? The following example shows how this is done.

First, one can specify publish ports with the "-p" flag:

    $ docker run -d -p 48522:22 --name pxc1 289923
    05253564fe90ae9e473f1ac34104e61f53c5db86d24e21266c8fefb6386477bb

Or, allow [Docker][Docker] to publish all exposed ports, automatically chosing the port:

    $ docker run -d -P --name pxc2 289923
    ddcceffb801ae6b2e9c1004187a784eaa2e8f9f66f9965898ef86227533c0271

To view the ports mapped on the host to the Docker ports for port 22:

    $ docker ps
    CONTAINER ID  IMAGE        COMMAND               CREATED        STATUS        PORTS                                                                                                                       NAMES
    ddcceffb801a  289923fa1196 "/bin/sh -c "/usr/lo  2 seconds ago  Up 2 seconds  0.0.0.0:49180->22/tcp, 0.0.0.0:49181->3306/tcp, 0.0.0.0:49182->4444/tcp, 0.0.0.0:49183->4567/tcp, 0.0.0.0:49184->9200/tcp   pxc2
    05253564fe90  289923fa1196 "/bin/sh -c "/usr/lo  22 seconds ago Up 22 seconds 3306/tcp, 4444/tcp, 4567/tcp, 9200/tcp, 0.0.0.0:48522->22/tcp                                                               pxc1

As one can see, one would use port 48522 on the host OS to connect to the container "pxc1" and port 49180 on the container "pxc2".

"docker inspect" can also be used, though is much more verbose. The port mapping found within several entries of the output for the container in question.

(Note: output formatted and reduced for instructional purposes)

    $ docker inspect pxc1
    [{
      "ID": "05253564fe90ae9e473f1ac34104e61f53c5db86d24e21266c8fefb6386477bb",
      "NetworkSettings": {
          "IPAddress": "172.17.0.2",
          "Ports": {
              "22/tcp": [
                  {
                      "HostIp": "0.0.0.0",
                      "HostPort": "48522"
                  }
              ],
              "3306/tcp": null,
              "4444/tcp": null,
              "4567/tcp": null,
              "9200/tcp": null
          }
      },
      "HostConfig": {
          "PortBindings": {
              "22/tcp": [
                  {
                      "HostIp": "0.0.0.0",
                      "HostPort": "48522"
                  }
              ],
              "3306/tcp": null,
              "4444/tcp": null,
              "4567/tcp": null,
              "9200/tcp": null
          },
    }]

## Cleanup 

Finally, there are several ways to stop containers, as well as some good house-keeping:

Sends a SIGTERM, and after a grace period, SIGKILL:

    $ docker stop <container>

Sends a SIGKILL:

    $ docker kill <container>

The above two, you can restart with

    $ docker start <container>

If you find that by running "docker ps -a" that you have a lot of stopped containers you no longer need and need to clean up, you would run:

    $ docker rm <container>

If you want to be lazy (and caveat emptor the author is not responsible!)

    $ docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)

Also, you may wish to clean up containers.

    $ docker rmi <image>

## Summary

This post was meant as an introduction to Docker and an attempt at providing the reader information on this new and exciting technology-- what [Docker][Docker] is, why one would want to use it, examples of how to use Docker with links to numerous sources of information about [Docker][Docker].

It should be obvious to a developer reading this post what the possibilities are with Docker and how it could revolutionize software development and delivery! 

There is so much more to discuss about [Docker][Docker] and I intend to continue posting more information about Docker in the future.
