I meant to get this post on my blog last week because I was waiting for the mirrors to updated, but better late than never.

I’m pleased to announce the release of DBD::mysql 4.027. This release isn’t a huge release but has some nice fixes nonetheless. Particularly, some fixes that improve building and installing on OS X.

Per the change log:

2014-13-15 Patrick Galbraith, Michiel Beijen, DBI/DBD community (4.027)

- Added more OS X notes and fixed compiler warnings
- Skip tests if test database is not present-RT92330 (zefram ``<zefram at fysh dot org>``
- metacpan.org and search.cpan.org didn't display module POD, caused by fix for RT90101. Reported by Oleg, RT92350.

As before, thank you to Michael Beijen and the community for your help!
