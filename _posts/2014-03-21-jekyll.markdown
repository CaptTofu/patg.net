For the longest time, I've used [Livejournal][livejournal] for my blog but recently thought it might be good to do something different with my blog as I felt mine was looking a bit dated. There are currently a number of different options for those who want to blog their thoughts and ideas to the world such as [Blogger][blogger], [Type Pad][typepad], and [Word Press][wordpress]. Those are all good options with various features depending on what one is looking for and technical level. For me, I wanted something that allowed me to build my site, to as much a degree as possible, tools that I use for my daily job. One of my favorite tools and the tool I use more than anything is the [Vim][vim] editor. Secondly, I use [Git][git] and specifically for publishing [git][git]-managed projects, [Github][github]. 

You see, I don't really like most Graphical UIs. I find them cumbersome and that they often just get in the way of wanting to do simple things. Also, since I work so much on automating so many different things, I'm just innately predisposed to doing work on the command line. Hence, I gravitate to tools that suit my modus operandi.

After speaking with my friend Brian Aker, he mentioned to me this project called [Jekyll][jekyll]. When he told me I could simply use [Git][git] and [Vim][vim] to edit and manage it, that was all I needed to hear.
<br />
## How to build your site with Jekyll

I assumed I wouldn't even try to migrate my old blog to the new site, which is sufficient for me in that I can simply refer people to [Livejournal][livejournal] to see old posts, however [Jekyll][jekyll] offers [jekyll-import][jekyll-import] as a means to import pages from [Drupal][drupal], [Wordpress][wordpress], Google Reader, [Joomla][joomla], etc. (though not [Livejournal][livejournal]... yet).
<br />
## First steps

This post is intended to keep it very simple but get you up and running. You are welcome to review the more detailed features of [Jekyll][jekyll] on their [site][jekyll].
<br />
### Prerequisites

- Ruby
- RVM
- editor of your choice
- [Github][github] account
- Knowledge of [Markdown][markdown]
<br />
<br />

### Install Jekyll

First, you obviously have to install [Jekyll][jekyll]. You will want in advance to make sure to set up [RVM][rvm]. Install the gem:

    gem install jekyll
<br />
### Create a post

Create a [markdown][markdown] page with the contents you want. You must create a page named with a timestamp YYYY-MM-DD-my-post.markdown. Example:

    vi _posts/2014-03-21-my-post.markdown
<br />
### Serve up the page locally

Jekyll comes with the ability to serve up the page locally with a lightweight development web-server to view your changes. 

    jekyll serve

And then access the page

    http://host:4000

I run everything in a vmware instance, so of course the ``host`` value is the IP address of my virtual machine.

At this point, it would be necessary to have the generated site be publicly available. [Jekyll][jekyll] powers [Github Pages][github-pages], so the next steps pertain how to set up both [Github Pages][github-pages] and DNS.
<br />
## Setting up [Github Pages][github-pages]

The following section I wanted to describe the process for setting up [Github Pages][github-pages]. The documentation on the site is excellent, but there are some things that I thought describing would help.
<br />
### Create a [Github Pages][github-pages] repository

You will need to create a [Github Pages][github-pages] repository. The instructions on how to do this are very simple per the [documentation][github-pages]. 

- I followed the directions for ``Project site`` on the site though you may need an organizational site.
- I selected ``Start from scratch``

I created a repository called ``patg.net``.
<br />
### Set the default branch in the repository to ``gh-pages``

As the header suggests, you will want to set the default branch in your repository (using regular [Github][github])

![default branch gh-pages](/assets/gh-pages.png "gh-pages")
<br />
### Set up your repository

Inside of your site's directory, git initialize it

    $ git init
    $ git add .

Then add the remote to the [Github Pages][github-pages] repository. In my case, I ran the following:
    
    git remote add origin https://github.com/CaptTofu/patg.net.git
<br />
### Commit the changes

Add the post and commit (if you are adding a new post, not needed due to previous step)

    $ git add _posts/2013-03-21-new-post.markdown
<br />
### Push the changes

Push to the repository, once you are certain that's what you wish to publish after viewing locally with the development web-server. Push to the gh-pages branch:

    $ git push origin gh-pages
<br />
### View your changes on your site!

Initially, if you don't have DNS set up, you will view your site on [Github Pages][github-pages] as something like:

    http://capttofu.github.io/patg.net

If you are going to keep it this way, you will need to set ``_config.yml`` to have the following:

    baseurl: /

If you switch DNS to this being a primary, non-sub-domain site, this line can be removed.
<br />
## Setting up DNS

Depending on your provider, you will need to set up DNS to either use a CNAME to point to the new blog, or as in my case, I wanted this to be ``http://patg.net`` and not a subdomain site, so I had to create two A-records to:

- 192.30.252.153
- 192.30.252.154 

<br />
## Add a CNAME file

The directions state you will need a file called ``CNAME``, which simply contains:

    patg.net

At this point your site should be fully functioning!
<br />
## Other features and enhancements

There are a number of other things to add to a [Jekyll][jekyll] site. This section covers those which my site needed.
<br />
### Comments

What about comments? Well, for me, I decided to use [Disqus][disqus]. All I had to simply do was to add the div tag that [Disqus][disqus] provides you from their site to the file ``_layouts/post.html``:

    <div class="post">
    {{ content }}
    </div>
    <div id="disqus_thread"></div>
        <script type="text/javascript">
            /* * * CONFIGURATION VARIABLES: EDIT BEFORE PASTING INTO YOUR WEBPAGE * * */
            var disqus_shortname = 'patgnet'; 
     ... SNIP ...
<br />
### RSS Feeds

I wanted my site to be able to be picked up by a number of "Planet" sites. For this, I needed RSS. This is very easy to add. Simply run the following in the directory containg your site repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/snaptortoise/jekyll-rss-feeds
    $ cp jekyll-rss-feeds/feed.xml patg.net/
    $ cd patg.net
    $ git add feed.xml
    $ git push origin gh-pages

That's all!
<br />

### RedCarpet

In order to have [Redcarpet][redcarpet], the [markdown][markdown] library that [Github Pages][github-pages] uses which offers features stock [markdown][markdown] doesn't, you can install this module into the ``_plugins`` directory simply by doing the following:

    $ cd patg.net/_plugins
    $ wget https://github.com/nono/Jekyll-plugins/blob/master/redcarpet2_markdown.rb
    $ git add redcarpet2_markdown.rb

Add it to ``_config.yml``:

    markdown: redcarpet
    redcarpet:
      extensions: ["no_intra_emphasis", "fenced_code_blocks", "autolink", "strikethrough", "superscript"]

You will also need to install the gem ``albino`` for it to work:

    gem install albino
<br />

## Summary 

With this post, you should have my example of how I set up my site as a good start for yourself. Mileage may vary, but I do think this should help, along with the various documentation on 
both [Jekyll][jekyll]'s and [Github Pages][github-pages] websites to get your own site set up.

As I mentioned before, there are far many more options and useful bits of information I could have delved into that even I haven't fully utilized and if I feel inspired upon learning more, you can be certain to look here on my site about those realizations!
